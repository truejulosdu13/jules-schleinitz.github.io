</p>

We compiled a literature extracted data on nickel carbon-oxygen aromatic coupling in order to evaluate how precise yield prediction can be for such data. In collaboration with [Maxime Langevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-langevin-1aa58912b/?originalSubdomain=fr), we go beyond random split and perform predictions with publication or coupling partner splits to have a better idea of the usefullness of **Machine Learning** prediction techniques for academic synthesis laboratories or computer assisted synthesis planning using literature datasets.

This work is conducted under the supervision of [Laurence Grimaud](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/laurence-grimaud/), [Maxime Vitale](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/maxime-r-vitale/) and [Rodolphe Villeumier](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/recherche/laboratoire-pasteur/chimie-theorique/members-of-the-theoretical-chemistry-group/rodolphe-vuilleumier/).

I describe the electrochemical behaviour of alloxazine and isoalloxazine ligands as well as the species resulting from their complexation to one, three or six nickel centers, these molecules are synthetized by the group of [Marine Desage-El Murr](http://marinedesageelmurr.fr/).
I used **electrochemistry** methods to quantify the redox potentials of the complexes and understand their reactivity.
For some semi-quinone nickel complexes, the successive one electron oxydation potentials depend on the counter anion used. DFT modeling gives insights on the reasons of this influence. The calculations were made under the supervision of [Ilaria Ciofini](https://www.chimieparistech.psl.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ilariaciofini-notice-biographique.pdf).

Results on alloxazine-nickel trimer and hexamer are published in *Inorg. Chem. Front.* and *Chem. Eur. J*:

What make the O.A. on PDI-NO<sub>2</sub> substrate so easy compared to nitro benzene ? We show that a S.E.T mechanism rather than a concerted oxydative addition is involved in the case of the PDI-NO<sub>2</sub>. This mechanistic study was performed in collaboration with the Hudhomme group, who realized the first coupling with PDI-NO<sub>2</sub>.
DFT study was performed n collaboration with the group of [Ilaria Ciofini](https://www.chimieparistech.psl.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ilariaciofini-notice-biographique.pdf) : [Anna Perfetto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-perfetto-2a2a55143/?originalSubdomain=fr) and Clara Chinchilla. The experimental studies were done in our lab by Clara Chinchilla, Aurelien Bailly and myself under the supervision of [Laurence Grimaud](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/laurence-grimaud/) and [Maxime Vitale](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/maxime-r-vitale/).
