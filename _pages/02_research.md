          Prediction of reaction yields for nickel-based coupling reactions - ML and DFT featurization

description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
We compiled a literature extracted data on nickel carbon-oxygen aromatic coupling in order to evaluate how precise yield prediction can be for such data. In collaboration with [Maxime Langevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-langevin-1aa58912b/?originalSubdomain=fr), we go beyond random split and perform predictions with publication or coupling partner splits to have a better idea of the usefullness of **Machine Learning** prediction techniques for academic synthesis laboratories or computer assisted synthesis planning using literature datasets.

This work is conducted under the supervision of [Laurence Grimaud](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/laurence-grimaud/), [Maxime Vitale](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/maxime-r-vitale/) and [Rodolphe Villeumier](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/recherche/laboratoire-pasteur/chimie-theorique/members-of-the-theoretical-chemistry-group/rodolphe-vuilleumier/).
