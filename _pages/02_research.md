We compiled a literature extracted data on nickel carbon-oxygen aromatic coupling in order to evaluate how precise yield prediction can be for such data. In collaboration with [Maxime Langevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxime-langevin-1aa58912b/?originalSubdomain=fr), we go beyond random split and perform predictions with publication or coupling partner splits to have a better idea of the usefullness of **Machine Learning** prediction techniques for academic synthesis laboratories or computer assisted synthesis planning using literature datasets.

This work is conducted under the supervision of [Laurence Grimaud](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/laurence-grimaud/), [Maxime Vitale](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/maxime-r-vitale/) and [Rodolphe Villeumier](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/recherche/laboratoire-pasteur/chimie-theorique/members-of-the-theoretical-chemistry-group/rodolphe-vuilleumier/).

* <b> Characterisation of Nickel Complexes Structure and Reactivity <\b>

I describe the electrochemical behaviour of alloxazine and isoalloxazine ligands as well as the species resulting from their complexation to one, three or six nickel centers, these molecules are synthetized by the group of [Marine Desage-El Murr](http://marinedesageelmurr.fr/).
I used **electrochemistry** methods to quantify the redox potentials of the complexes and understand their reactivity.
For some semi-quinone nickel complexes, the successive one electron oxydation potentials depend on the counter anion used. DFT modeling gives insights on the reasons of this influence. The calculations were made under the supervision of [Ilaria Ciofini](https://www.chimieparistech.psl.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ilariaciofini-notice-biographique.pdf).

Results on alloxazine-nickel trimer and hexamer are published in *Inorg. Chem. Front.* and *Chem. Eur. J*:
