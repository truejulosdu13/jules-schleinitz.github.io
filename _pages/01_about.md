Hi, my name is Jules and I'm a Ph.D. student in chemistry working at [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/en/chemistry-department-of-ens/) in Paris under the supervision of [Laurence Grimaud](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/laurence-grimaud/). I use a combination of experimental and theoretical tools to understand chemical reaction pathways. Among them **XRD**, **UV-visible**, **IR**, **EPR**, and **NMR** spectroscopies as well as **electrochemistry** and theoretical tools: **DFT** and **Machine Learning**.
  Alongside with my research activities, I spend half of my time teaching chemistry at Ecole Normale Supérieure (Organic chemistry: lessons, electrochemistry: tutorials and experimental sessions, experimental projects for bachelor and master students.).
