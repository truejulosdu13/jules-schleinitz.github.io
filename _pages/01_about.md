Jules is currently a postdoctoral scholar at CalTech in the group of [Sarah E. Reisman](http://reismangroup.caltech.edu/) and a current member of the NSF [Center for Computer Assisted Synthesis](https://ccas.nd.edu/). His research focuses on the development of computational and machine learning tools for organic synthesis planning through mechanistic understanding.
Jules graduated in 2022 from the [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/en/chemistry-department-of-ens/) in Paris. His PhD intitled "Machine learning and Mechanistic Analysis" was supervised by [Laurence Grimaud](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/grimaud/current-team/team-leaders/laurence-grimaud/).
  Alongside with his research activities, Jules spent half of his PhD teaching chemistry at Ecole Normale Supérieure (Organic chemistry: lessons, electrochemistry: tutorials and experimental sessions, experimental projects for bachelor and master students.).
